Are you ready for a new invitation-only pop-up restaurant experience that will tantalize your taste buds and transport you to a different time and place? Then you won’t want to miss this cozy speakeasy/restaurant located in the scenic German countryside (actually, UTC), where you can enjoy traditional German sausages and vegan/vegetarian fare in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Besen Hardy is a pop-up I've been longing to recreate for decades that combines the charm of a Besenwirtschaft with the allure of a speakeasy. A Besenwirtschaft is a seasonal wine tavern in Germany that serves homemade wine and traditional food, often in the owner’s backyard or barn. Imagine the best of both worlds, where you can savor delicious sausages, wine, beers, and house-made ciders while listening to music and mingling with friendly locals. This is an opportunity to experience a traditional German wine country family-style meal without the travel. Don’t miss this chance to discover this unique pop-up restaurant experience, where every bite and sip will make you feel like you are part of a special secret. Book your reservation today and get ready for an unforgettable culinary adventure.
This pop-up restaurant is only open to invited guests and their guests for 10 nights this fall (2024), and you’ll need a reservation and a password to get in. Contact Mary to book your spot today and get ready for an unforgettable culinary adventure.
There is a family-style table that seats 14, and 4 seats at the Chef's Table, a counter where you can check out all the action. If you'd like to dress up and help me take orders and serve, there are volunteer slots you can sign up for to join in the fun. 

2024 dates available in Sept, Oct, and Nov.
